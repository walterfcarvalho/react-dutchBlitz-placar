# Dutch Blitz Placar

Dutch BlitzÂ® is a highly interactive, highly energetic, family-friendly card game that will test your skills, smarts and speed.

Once we need to take notes during the game, I thought I could do an application to do this, using React JS, get some practice, join funny and knowledge.
